[LOG_CAT_ML] You must specify a valid HCA device by setting:
-x HCOLL_MAIN_IB=<dev_name:port> or -x UCX_NET_DEVICES=<dev_name:port>.
If no device was specified for HCOLL (or the calling library), automatic device detection will be run.
In case of unfounded HCA device please contact your system administrator.
